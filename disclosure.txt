On November 2018, I informed Symantec for two vulnerabilities in Symantec Manager, which could allow escalation of privilege (EoP). 
Both vulnerabilities have been verified by Symantec and one of them has been assigned CVE-2018-18367 .
They published the advisory for the CVE after 140 days!

However, for the second one and after 8 months (!) of waiting, there is no advisory yet.

Initially, they asked from me to expand the 90 days disclosure and wait until June 2018. 
They claimed that the SEPM has a dependency on a 3rd party vendor and they will wait a full patch from their vendor.
These days (end of July) they informed me for a new delay, until mid to late August.

I have to stress at that point, that I tested the exploitation against "Symantec EndPoint Manager 14.2.1 (14.2 RU1) build 3332 (14.2.3332.1000)", and it seems that Symantec applied a patch. 

However, there is no security advisory, because they wait the patch from the 3rd party vendor.

Being a strong believer of responsible disclosure, and talking into consideration all the above, I release the exploit.

As far as you have upgraded to the latest SEPM, my guess is that you will have no problems. 

If you have not upgraded, then probably you are already affected by CVE-2018-18367.
